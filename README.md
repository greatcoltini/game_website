### Minigames
Within this survival game, a lot of the necessary interactions will be done through minigames.

One instance of this is the fishing minigame. In order to catch fish, the player must use their fishing rod and lure, and time their catch.
Each fish in this game has unique properties, and unique environments with which they will swim in.
